Calculate: 
2x4BoardFoot cost = cost of stud / length of stud in feet.
2x6BoardFoot cost = 2x4BoardFoot cost * 6/4
number of studs = (2L+2W)*12/16+4
cost of studs = number of studs*cost of stud
number of floor joists = length*12/16+1
cost of floor joists = number of floor joists*width*2x6BoardFootCost. 
number of roof joists = number of floor joists + 2
cost of roof joists = number of floor joists*(width+2)*2x6BoardFootCost
