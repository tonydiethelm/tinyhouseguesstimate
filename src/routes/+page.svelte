Mobile First! But there's no needed navigation here, this is SPA. 
Frankly, this isn't a mobile kind of thing, they'll need to open tabs for pricing. 
Still, run it down the middle, separate sections with pictures or horizontal rules? 
We want a running cost DIV floating on the upper right corner.

Calculate: 
2x4BoardFoot cost = cost of stud / length of stud in feet.
2x6BoardFoot cost = 2x4BoardFoot cost * 6/4
number of studs = (2L+2W)*12/16+4
cost of studs = number of studs*cost of stud
number of floor joists = length*12/16+1
cost of floor joists = number of floor joists*width*2x6BoardFootCost. 
number of roof joists = number of floor joists + 2
cost of roof joists = number of floor joists*(width+2)*2x6BoardFootCost
circumference in feet = length*2+width*2
number of wall sheathing ply = circumference /4
number of roof and floor sheathing ply = 2* (length /4)
sheathing ply cost = sheathing cost * (number of wall sheathingy ply + number of roof and wall sheathing ply)
