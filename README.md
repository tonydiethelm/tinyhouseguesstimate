# Tiny House cost guesstimate

## Purpose
This is supposed to help people guesstimate the cost of a Tiny House build. 

## What's covered?

Trailer (if needed), framing, sheathing, water barrier, insulation, roofing, windows, door, shower, cabinets, sink, rough electrical, rough plumbing, flooring, drywall. 

## Methodology

This is rough napkin math here. We're taking rough dimensions and doing rough math. This will get you in the ballpark, but that's it. 

## Next Steps
If you're building a Tiny House, the success of your endeavor will be directly related to how well you planned. You should have a framing plan, an electrical plan, a plumbing plan. You don't need architect level plans, but they do need to be dimensioned. You should have a budget. There should be spreadsheets. You don't want to wing this...
